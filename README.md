This project involved conducting data mining on Titanic dataset evaluating if a passenger will survive or not. Three binary classification algorithms were used to perform the prediction- Random Forest, Decision Trees and Na√Øve Bayes classification. It explored various factors that help to improve the model accuracy and evaluated the results based on various performance metrics. The analysis of correlation, partitioning method, feature selection and the performance metrics provided insights into the various algorithm performances and their relevance on the Titanic dataset. The KNIME software was used to conduct the data mining for this project.
